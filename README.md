This project implements an advanced system to automate the counting of vials in images using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The solution is designed to enhance inventory management accuracy and efficiency in pharmaceutical and laboratory environments by replacing manual vial counting with an AI-powered method. The system has achieved 96% accuracy, offering high precision and recall, and reducing manual counting efforts by 10%.
Features :
Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate detection of vials in images.
Automated Counting: Automatically counts the number of vials in each image.
High Accuracy: Achieves 96% accuracy in detection and counting.
Efficiency Improvement: Reduces manual counting workload by 10%.
User-friendly Interface: Integrated into an easy-to-use application.
Dataset :
A custom dataset was prepared and annotated for training the YOLOv8 model.
Images include a variety of vial arrangements and lighting conditions to improve model robustness.
